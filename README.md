# MSRefine
MSRefine is a tool that assists users in optimizing performance of LC-MS/MS and summaries metrics for best assisting users in deeper proteome profiling.
It can quickly extract more than 30 kinds of metrics, design scoring formulas and display visual reports, assisting users in locating the source of problems and pointing out optimization directions. 
Using MSRefine, we compare and analyze the change conditions of multiple pairs of data sets to illustrate the important role tool plays in whole-process monitoring and optimization. 
In addition, MSRefine can quickly determine a set of optimal parameter settings for new samples, new equipment, and new methods to identify more peptides and proteins. 
This tool is also conducive to the transfer of experimental methods between laboratories and the evaluation and comparison of instrument performance, giving full play to the advantages of the chromatography-mass spectrometry platform.
